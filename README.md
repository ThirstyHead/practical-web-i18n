# Practical Web i18n and l10n
If you ask a software developer which language they should use, they'll most likely answer in terms of a programming language -- Java or C#, JavaScript or TypeScript, etc. But what about which written or spoken language they should use? Only 5% of the world speaks English, yet over 50% of websites are written in English. There are roughly 7,000 languages in the world, and Amazon.com supports only 15 of them.

In this talk, Scott Davis (Principal Engineer, ThoughtWorks) shows you how to make your World Wide Web site, well, truly world-wide. We'll discuss Internationalization (i18n) and Localization (l10n). We'll explore solutions that allow you to localize individual words and phrases, as well as whole pages. We'll discuss using subtitles to broaden your global audience for audio and video content. And we'll talk about the challenges of making Conversational UIs global.
